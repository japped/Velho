# Velho
Velho is my  Discord bot, funny guy if I am to judge.

## Installation
To install this bot, you need to rename the config.json.example to config.json.


## Open Source
I want to keep this bot's "regular" version as Open Source, as mentioned here. It is important for me to see people contributing to it.
